## 📊 Sales Analysis using SQL

This project focuses on analyzing sales performance using **SQL queries** to extract meaningful insights from transactional data.  
The dataset includes information such as customer details, product categories, order dates, quantities, revenue, and regional sales distribution.

## 🔍 Key Insights from the SQL Sales Analysis

- Sales trends were analyzed across **months, regions, products, and customer segments**.
- Identified **top-performing products** and **best-selling categories** that contribute the most revenue.
- SQL aggregations helped calculate **total sales**, **average order value**, **profit margins**, and **year-over-year growth**.
- Customer analysis revealed the **highest-value customers**, repeat purchase behavior, and regional buying patterns.
- Time-based queries showed **daily, monthly, and quarterly sales trends**, helping identify peak seasons.
- Used SQL joins to combine multiple tables such as **orders, customers, products, and sales transactions**.
- Window functions (if used) helped measure **ranking**, **running totals**, and **moving averages**.
- Anomalies such as sudden spikes or drops in sales were identified using comparative filtering.
- These insights can support business decisions like inventory planning, targeted marketing, and pricing strategies.
